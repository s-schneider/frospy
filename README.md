## Toroidal Mode Splittingfunctions

The splittingfunctions of our [toroidal mode overtone paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaa567) can be found here:

## Installation
I recommend to run this toolbox using anaconda.

[Follow the instructions on their homepage](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

[How to manage your environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

Create a new environment:
```
$ conda create -n frospy_env python=3.7
$ conda activate frospy_env
(frospy_env) $
```

Install required packages
```
(frospy_env) $ ./install_requirements
```

Install nmpy
clone this repo
```
(frospy_env) $ cd into frospy
(frospy_env) $ chmod 755 install.sh
(frospy_env) $ chmod 755 update.sh
(frospy_env) $ ./install.sh
```

start ipython

voilÃ¡

## Update

To update the current branch, run  
`./update.sh`

To update other branches, run  
`./update.sh Branch_Name`

## Usage
```
from frospy.spectrum.app import spectrum
data = 'PATH-TO-DATA-FILE'
syn = 'PATH-TO-SYNTHETICS-FILE'
spectrum(data, syn)
```

## Spectrum
Spectrum is an example tool that uses frospy's core classes to plot normal mode frequency spectra.

## Run
To run spectrum enter the following line
```
(nmpy) $ ipython run_spectrum.py
```

For most of the [commands](#commands) keyword-arguments (kwargs) are allowed
### Commands and kwargs
After a command is entered, some additional information or keywords may be
needed as a keyword argument (kwarg). E.g. after entering `modes`, the name of
the modes is asked:  
Example 1
```
Waiting for user input (type help for all commands)
 -->  modes
Showing modes? (all / none / names (separated by space), e.g. 0S15) -->  0s15
```

The additional keyword can be added after the command as well,
separated by ` - `, having the same outcome as Example 1:  
Example 2
```
Waiting for user input (type help for all commands)
 -->  modes - 0s15
 ```
 The same goes for `tw`, `fw` etc.

### Picking Frequency Windows
 To pick a frequency window for a segment file enter:
 ```
Waiting for user input (type help for all commands)
 -->  p
 ```
 A window will pop up, in which you can pick 2 frequencies by clicking on the
 data. If you already now your frequencies you can enter
 ```
Waiting for user input (type help for all commands)
 -->  p - f1 f2
 ```
 The same goes for `pa`, which sets/calculates the frequency picks, timewindow
 and weighting for all stations, and `pf`, which does it only for the following
 stations.

### Timewindow and tapershape test
* To test a range of timewindows you may enter `tw test`, which will ask for a
mode to calculate the qcycle 'qT' of that it. 2 new plot windows pop up with
timewindows in a range of [1, qT/2] to [1, 3/2*qT] for data and synthetics.

* To test a range of taper shapes you may enter `taper test`, calculating
the spectrum in the current time- and frequency-window for the following
functions ([more documentation here][1]):
  * hanning - window
  * hamming - window
  * blackman - window
  * kaiser - window
  * bartlett - window
